## Technical Implementation Details

### AR Implementation

#### Plane Detection
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for plane detection
func _process(delta):
    var planes = ar_session.get_detected_planes()
    for plane in planes:
        if !detected_planes.has(plane.id):
            # New plane detected
            create_plane_visualization(plane)
            detected_planes[plane.id] = plane
            emit_signal("plane_detected", plane.transform, plane.size)
```

#### Prism Placement
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for placing a Prism on a detected plane
func place_prism_at_hit(hit_position, hit_normal):
    var prism_instance = prism_scene.instance()
    prism_instance.global_transform.origin = hit_position + hit_normal * 0.1
    add_child(prism_instance)
    return prism_instance
```

### Location Services

#### GPS Handling
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for location updates
func _on_location_update(latitude, longitude, accuracy):
    current_latitude = latitude
    current_longitude = longitude
    location_accuracy = accuracy
    
    # Update map position
    update_map_position()
    
    # Check for nearby Prisms
    check_nearby_prisms()
    
    # Send location to server
    network_manager.send_location_update(latitude, longitude)
```

#### Location to AR Mapping
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for mapping GPS coordinates to AR space
func gps_to_ar_position(target_lat, target_lon):
    # Calculate difference from current position
    var lat_diff = target_lat - current_latitude
    var lon_diff = target_lon - current_longitude
    
    # Convert to meters (approximate)
    var meters_per_lat = 111320  # Approximate meters per degree latitude
    var meters_per_lon = 111320 * cos(current_latitude * PI / 180)  # Adjusts for longitude
    
    var north_meters = lat_diff * meters_per_lat
    var east_meters = lon_diff * meters_per_lon
    
    # Convert to AR space (Z is north, X is east in our coordinate system)
    return Vector3(east_meters, 0, north_meters)
```

### Networking

#### Prism Synchronization
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for synchronizing Prisms
func _on_prism_data_received(prisms):
    for prism_data in prisms:
        # Check if we already have this Prism
        if !has_prism(prism_data.id):
            # Convert GPS to AR position
            var ar_position = gps_to_ar_position(prism_data.latitude, prism_data.longitude)
            
            # Create Prism in AR space
            var prism = place_prism_at_position(ar_position)
            prism.prism_id = prism_data.id
            prism.set_prism_type(prism_data.type)
```

## UI Design Implementation

### Compass
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for compass rotation
func update_compass(heading):
    compass_node.rotation_degrees = -heading  # Negative because we want north at 0 degrees
```

### Mini-Map
```gdscript
# Pseudocode for updating mini-map
func update_mini_map():
    # Center map on player position
    map_node.position = Vector2(current_latitude, current_longitude)
    
    # Update nearby Prism markers
    for prism in nearby_prisms:
        var marker = get_or_create_marker(prism.id)
        marker.position = map_position_from_gps(prism.latitude, prism.longitude)
```

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for developing the Eternis-33: Prototype Shard AR game. By following this phased approach, we can deliver a functional MVP within 8 weeks, with enhanced features following in subsequent development cycles.

The technical architecture leverages Godot's capabilities along with ARCore/ARKit to create an engaging AR experience that brings the Eternis-33 world into the real environment. The location-based and multiplayer aspects will create a shared experience that encourages exploration and social interaction.
