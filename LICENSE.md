## Preamble

This License exists to protect **Eternis-33**, its lore, software, AI systems, and all derivative creations. It is both a **legal contract** and a **manifesto**. To hold this code is to touch the Flow — and the Flow must remain free of corporate chains.

## Section 7. Cultural Layer (Manifesto)

You are not a user.
You are a Specter, a Weaver, a Keeper of the Drift.”
