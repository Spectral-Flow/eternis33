## Welcome to Your Eternis-33 Companion

Congratulations on acquiring your personal AI companion for the Eternis-33 simulation. This guide will help you understand how to interact with your companion and make the most of its capabilities.

2. "Your preferred approach to problem-solving:"
   - Methodical and precise
   - Creative and intuitive

Answer honestly to ensure your companion's personality aligns with your preferences.
