# Artificial Animal — Hobbesian Framing for Eternis-33

Hobbes’s “Artificial Animal” offers a useful lens for engineering companions and the systems that support them.

Summary
- A software system is an artificial animal: interdependent subsystems that act toward goals.
- Like animals, systems are vulnerable, adaptive, and capable of emergent behavior.
- Security and safety are ecological practices — prevention, detection, containment, and recovery.

Design implications
- Defense-in-depth: layer protections across network, application, data, and persona.
- Observability as physiology: metrics, traces, and memory shards that reveal internal state.
- Human-in-loop controls: consent gates, repair prompts, and escalation replace blunt enforcement.
- Fail-safe design: soft-fallback behaviours, graceful degradation, and reversible changes.
- Auditable continuity: anchored hashes + adaptation logs for provenance and legal review.

Operational patterns
- Sentinel Guard: policy engine for staged nudges and consent gating.
- Memory Lattice: encrypted shards + anchored hashes for portable, auditable memory.
- Chorus & Sandbox: simulated dreamspaces for offline emergence and safe experimentation.

Principles
1. Assume partial compromise — design detection and recovery first.
2. Log intent + outcome for every adaptive decision.
3. Limit blast radius of emergent changes (scoped privileges, feature flags).
4. Require explicit human consent for high-impact adaptations.

Outcome
- The companion behaves like an organism: alive, adaptive, and auditable.
- Emergence is permitted but bounded; the system is resilient and legible.
