{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I\'ll help you create a prototype for the Eternis-33 AR game. Let me analyze the requirements and develop a plan for implementation.\n\n## Initial Analysis\n\nLooking at your requirements, you\'re envisioning an AR mobile game called "Eternis-33: Prototype Shard" that uses AR technology to place virtual "Prism" objects in the real world. Players can collect these objects, which are tied to real-world GPS coordinates and can be seen by other players.\n\nLet me create a structured plan to implement this prototype.\n\n## Project Planning\n\nFirst, I\'ll create a todo list to guide our development process:\n\n```markdown\n# Eternis-33: Prototype Shard Development Plan\n\n## Research & Setup\n- [ ] Evaluate Godot 4.x AR capabilities\n- [ ] Set up development environment\n- [ ] Research AR plugins for Android (ARCore) and iOS (ARKit)\n- [ ] Investigate OpenStreetMap and Mapbox API integration\n\n## Core Functionality\n- [ ] Create basic AR scene detection (planes, walls)\n- [ ] Implement Prism object visualization\n- [ ] Develop GPS location anchoring\n- [ ] Create player inventory system\n- [ ] Design UI elements (compass, mini-map)\n\n## Visual & Audio Design\n- [ ] Design Prism shard 3D model\n- [ ] Create shader for neon glow effect\n- [ ] Implement sound effects for Prism interaction\n- [ ] Design minimalist UI in cyberpunk style\n\n## Networking\n- [ ] Set up basic backend for Prism location storage\n- [ ] Implement multiplayer synchronization\n- [ ] Create persistence system for Prisms\n\n## Lore Integration\n- [ ] Implement first collection text popup\n- [ ] Design basic lore screen\n\n## Testing\n- [ ] Test AR functionality on Android\n- [ ] Test GPS anchoring\n- [ ] Test multiplayer synchronization\n```\n\nLet\'s start by setting up our development environment and exploring Godot\'s AR capabilities.\n\n<function_calls>\n<execute-command>\nmkdir -p eternis33_prototype/src\ncd eternis33_prototype\ngodot --version || echo "Godot not installed"\n</execute-command>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
