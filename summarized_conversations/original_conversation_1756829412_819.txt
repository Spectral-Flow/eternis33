{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Great! We\'ve successfully created our project structure. Now, let\'s create the necessary files for our Eternis-33 prototype. Since we can\'t directly run Godot in this environment, we\'ll focus on creating the code and assets that would be used in a Godot project.\n\nLet\'s start by creating a project specification document and then move on to implementing the core components of our prototype.\n\n<function_calls>\n<create-file file_path="eternis33_prototype/docs/project_specification.md">\n# Eternis-33: Prototype Shard Specification\n\n## Overview\nEternis-33: Prototype Shard is an AR mobile game set in the cyberpunk world of Eternis-33. Players use their mobile devices to discover and collect "Prism Anchors" - glowing crystalline shards that appear in the real world through AR technology.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\n### Platforms\n- Android (using ARCore)\n- iOS (using ARKit)\n\n### Engine\n- Godot 4.x\n\n### Core Technologies\n- AR: ARCore (Android), ARKit (iOS)\n- GPS/Mapping: OpenStreetMap + Mapbox API\n- Networking: WebSocket / lightweight backend\n\n## Core Gameplay Loop\n\n### 1. Startup\n- Player launches app\n- Camera opens in AR view\n- UI overlay shows compass and small map with current GPS position\n\n### 2. Scan Environment\n- ARCore/ARKit detects planes (ground, walls)\n- Player taps to "reveal" a Prism Anchor in the AR space\n\n### 3. Prism Artifact\n- A glowing Prism crystal appears anchored to real-world coordinates\n- Visual: Floating neon shard with animated shader (simple bloom/glow)\n- Sound: Low synth hum\n\n### 4. Interaction\n- Player taps Prism to collect it\n- Prism is added to player\'s inventory\n- Basic inventory screen shows Prism count\n\n### 5. Persistence\n- Prism is anchored at that GPS coordinate\n- Other players who visit the same location can see/collect the same Prism\n\n### 6. Lore Hook\n- On first collection: Small text popup with lore snippet\n- "You hold a Prism. Data condensed into crystal. The city remembers you."\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### AR Implementation\n- Use ARCore/ARKit to detect real-world surfaces\n- Place virtual Prism objects on detected surfaces\n- Implement touch interaction with virtual objects\n\n### GPS & Location\n- Use device GPS to get player location\n- Map current location using OpenStreetMap/Mapbox\n- Associate Prism spawns with specific GPS coordinates\n\n### Networking\n- Simple client-server architecture\n- Server stores Prism locations and states\n- Clients synchronize with server to see shared Prisms\n\n### Visual Design\n- Neon cyberpunk aesthetic\n- Glitch shimmer effects on Prisms\n- Color palette: Deep blues, magentas, cyan glows\n- Minimalist UI with clean white text, sans serif\n\n## Phase 2 Features (Stretch Goals)\n- Multiple Prism types (common, rare, corrupted)\n- Scintilla fragments (ambient AR particles, collectible)\n- Faction system (choose allegiance, contribute to territory control)\n- Time-based spawns (Prisms appear only at certain times)\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
