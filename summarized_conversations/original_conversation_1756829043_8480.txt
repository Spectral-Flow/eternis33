Players use their mobile devices to discover and collect "Prism Anchors" - glowing crystalline shards that appear in the real world through AR technology.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nEternis-33: Prototype Shard is a location-based AR game where players explore the real world to find and collect virtual Prism crystals. These Prisms are anchored to real-world GPS coordinates and can be seen and collected by other players, creating a shared experience.\n\n### Core Features\n\n- **AR Visualization**: Use ARCore/ARKit to place virtual Prism objects in the real world\n- **GPS Integration**: Anchor Prisms to real-world locations\n- **Collection Mechanics**: Tap Prisms to collect them and add to your inventory\n- **Multiplayer Persistence**: Prisms are visible to all players in the same location\n- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Neon visual style with glowing effects\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Engine & Platforms\n- **Engine**: Godot 4.x\n- **Platforms**: Android (ARCore), iOS (ARKit)\n- **AR Plugins**: godot-arcore (Android), equivalent for iOS\n- **Map/GPS**: OpenStreetMap + Mapbox API\n- **Networking**: WebSocket / lightweight backend\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\neternis33_prototype/\n├── assets/\n│   ├── models/       # 3D models for Prisms\n│   ├── textures/     # Textures including noise maps for shaders\n│   ├── sounds/       # Audio files for Prism and UI sounds\n│   └── ui/           # UI design files and mockups\n├── src/\n│   ├── ARController.gd       # Handles AR camera and plane detection\n│   ├── GameController.gd     # Main game controller\n│   ├── InventoryManager.gd   # Manages collected Prisms\n│   ├── LocationManager.gd    # Handles GPS and location services\n│   ├── Main.gd               # Entry point for the game\n│   ├── NetworkManager.gd     # Handles multiplayer communication\n│   ├── Prism.gd              # Prism object behavior\n│   └── UI.gd                 # User interface controller\n└── docs/\n    └── project_specification.md  # Detailed project specifications\n```\n\n### Core Gameplay Loop\n\n1. **Startup**: Player launches app → Camera opens in AR view with UI overlay\n2. **Scan Environment**: ARCore/ARKit detects planes → Player taps to reveal Prisms\n3. **Prism Artifact**: Glowing crystal appears anchored to real-world coordinates\n4. **Interaction**: Player taps Prism → Collects it → Added to Inventory\n5. **Persistence**: Prism remains anchored at GPS location for other players to find\n6. **Lore Hook**: First collection triggers lore popup introducing the world\n\n## Visual Design\n\n### Prism Visualization\n- Floating neon crystal with animated shader effects\n- Glowing bloom effect with color variations based on Prism type\n- Subtle animation (rotation, hovering)\n- Particle effects on interaction\n\n### UI Design\n- Minimalist cyberpunk aesthetic\n- Neon color palette (blues, magentas, cyan)\n- Clean white text with sans-serif fonts\n- Compass and mini-map for navigation\n- Inventory counter showing collected Prisms\n\n## Future Development (Phase 2)\n\n- Multiple Prism types (common, rare, corrupted)\n- Scintilla fragments (ambient AR particles, collectible)\n- Faction system (choose allegiance, contribute to territory control)\n- Time-based spawns (Prisms appear only at certain times)\n\n## Setup & Development\n\n### Requirements\n- Godot 4.x\n- Android SDK with ARCore support (for Android builds)\n- Xcode with ARKit support (for iOS builds)\n- OpenStreetMap/Mapbox API key\n\n### Building the Project\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Open the project in Godot 4.x\n3. Configure your API keys in the appropriate configuration files\n4. Build for your target platform (Android/iOS)\n\n## Credits\n\nDeveloped as part of the Eternis-33 cyberpunk world concept.\n\n### Assets\n- Noise textures generated using Python with NumPy and PIL\n- UI mockup created with HTML/CSS\n- Background image from Unsplash (for mockup only)\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
