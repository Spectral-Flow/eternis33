Once, this city breathed commerce and covenant, a jewel of land and law. Now it is a wound where data bleeds into night, where flesh and circuit wage their endless war.\r\nThe aether sings, unseen yet ceaseless, a spectral tide of memory and mathematics. It seeps into concrete, coils through wires, pools in broken machines until it crystallizes into prisms—shards of eternity, each a cage for voices long extinguished. Some clutch them like relics. Others grind them into powder and breathe the past as smoke. The brave dive headlong into their facets, risking fracture to glimpse what was, or what might be.\r\nAmong the ruin stride the castes of the neon age. Echo-Scribes ink the fading whispers, their vaults swollen with ghost-words. Fractoracles prophesy from corrupted code, their mouths dripping static as gospel. Choral Delvers descend into the crystalline catacombs, their ears filled with a hundred overlapping choirs. Sparkmongers wire mind to machine, soldering soul with trembling hands. Graftwrights stitch flesh to alloy until the seam itself becomes a creed. Framecarvers sculpt bodies into cathedrals of chrome and bone, walking icons of pain and art.\r\nAcross the boulevards march the Voxclad—corporate heralds whose every word is a contract, every sentence a shackle. Behind them lurk the Chronocensors, guardians of profit\'s timeline, hunting any who dare warp the flow of time for gain. In the underbellies, the Rustchanters mutter their hymns of alchemy, spinning gold from garbage, while Hollowkin slip through the shadows like vermin, scavenging the strata for morsels of tech the city itself has forgotten.\r\nAnd yet above all mortal stations loom the Legends, figures of whisper and dread. The Unceasing, whose stride knows no rest and whose lungs know no breath; a pilgrim of pain who never halts. The Sempiternal, veined with centuries of augmentation, unmoored from time\'s mercy, a living fossil clothed in chrome. The Quantum-Unmoored, shattered by the very code they embraced, flickering between realities, a pilgrim of uncertainty. And the Effluence, not a person but a tide, whose influence crashes like a flood and reshapes all it touches. Their names are sung in alleys, cursed in boardrooms, scratched into the steel bones of the city itself.\r\nBut know this: Eternis is not mercy. Eternis is not salvation. Eternis is persistence. In the neon dusk, when entropy gnaws the last foundations, when synaptic erosion rots the bridges between thought and self, when even the prisms themselves fade into static dust—still the city endures.\r\nEternis-33: a hymn to ruin, a psalm to persistence, an opera of flesh, chrome, and fading light.\r\nCore Concept\r\nTitle: Eternis-33\r\nGenre: Anime-style cyberpunk, suspense-heavy\r\nSetting: Denver, 2033 (distinct from Night City, rooted in its own culture, geography, and techno-decay)\r\nCore Themes: Neon vs. decay, body as battleground, corporate hegemony, cities as living characters\r\nUnique Elements: Digital aether as quasi-mystical substance, prisms as crystallized data/memories, faction-based society, legendary figures as urban myths\r\n\r\nSetting Overview\r\nCore Themes & Aesthetic\r\nEternis-33 presents a distinctive cyberpunk vision set in Denver 2033, characterized by several key themes:\r\nDecay vs. Technological Advancement: The juxtaposition of "neon" against decay, where advanced technology exists alongside crumbling infrastructure.\r\nBody as Battleground: Human bodies serve as canvases for technological augmentation, with various factions approaching this differently (Framecarvers as artists, Graftwrights as surgeons).\r\nDigital Metaphysics: The concept of "aether" as a quasi-mystical digital substrate that permeates the physical world, crystallizing into "prisms" that contain echoes of the past.\r\nCorporate Hegemony: Entities like the Voxclad and Chronocensors represent corporate control through language and time manipulation.\r\nPersistence Through Transformation: The core philosophy of "Eternis" itself—not salvation or mercy, but endurance through change.\r\nDistinctive Elements\r\nWhat sets Eternis-33 apart from other cyberpunk settings:\r\nDenver Setting: Moving away from the typical Asian-influenced megacities (like Night City) to explore the American West transformed.\r\nDigital Mysticism: The treatment of technology with religious/mystical terminology creates a techno-spirituality unique to this world.\r\nCaste-Like Social Structure: Society organized around specialized technological roles rather than traditional class divisions.\r\nCrystallized Data: The concept of "prisms" as physical manifestations of digital information provides a tangible metaphor for data.\r\nLegendary Figures: The mythic characters (The Unceasing, The Sempiternal, etc.) add a layer of urban legend and folklore.\r\nSocietal Structure\r\nDenver 2033 is stratified both physically and socially:\r\nThe Spires

These fundamental tensions exist at every level of the world:\r\nPermanence vs. Change\r\nAt its heart, Eternis-33 explores the tension between the desire for permanence and the inevitability of change. This manifests in:\r\nThe corporate attempt to control and freeze time (Chronocensors) vs. the natural flow and evolution of events\r\nThe preservation of memories in prisms vs. the natural process of forgetting\r\nThe extension of human life through technology vs. the natural cycle of life and death\r\nThe Voxclad\'s binding contracts vs. the Phantomscribes\' fluid identities\r\nIndividual vs. System\r\nThe struggle between personal freedom and systemic control permeates the setting:\r\nIndividual expression through body modification vs. corporate standardization\r\nPersonal memory and experience vs. collective data harvesting\r\nSelf-determination vs. contractual obligation\r\nThe right to privacy vs. ubiquitous surveillance\r\nIndependent factions vs. corporate hegemony\r\nTechnology vs. Humanity\r\nThe integration of technology with human existence creates fundamental questions:\r\nWhere does humanity end and technology begin?\r\nDoes augmentation enhance or diminish what makes us human?\r\nIs digital consciousness still human consciousness?\r\nCan technology preserve what matters about human experience?\r\nAre memories stored in prisms equivalent to lived experience?\r\nTruth vs. Perception\r\nIn a world where reality can be manipulated on multiple levels:\r\nThe distinction between actual events and manufactured memories\r\nThe reliability of sensory input in an augmented world\r\nThe nature of identity when it can be rewritten\r\nThe value of "authentic" experience vs. synthetic experience\r\nThe meaning of history when the past can be altered\r\nPotential Story Frameworks\r\nThe Prism Conspiracy\r\nPremise: A rare prism containing corporate secrets is stolen, triggering a multi-faction hunt across Denver\'s strata.\r\nKey

climate-controlled apartment 87 floors above Denver\'s smog layer, Elise Varda, a senior Contract Priest of the Voxclad Syndics, awakens precisely at 05:00 to the sound of a custom tone sequence designed to optimize neural activity. The smart-glass windows transition from night opacity to reveal a view of the Rocky Mountains silhouetted against the rising sun—a privilege reserved for those with sufficient corporate standing.\r\n"Apartment, morning protocol," she says, her voice activating systems throughout the living space. Her vocal implants glow subtly blue as they run through automatic calibration, ensuring her binding language will function at peak efficiency today.\r\nAs she performs her morning ablutions, corporate news feeds project directly onto her bathroom mirror:\r\nCHRONOCENSOR ALERT: Temporal compliance rates in Median sectors 7-12 down 3.2% this quarter. Increased enforcement authorized.\r\nFRAMECARVER SHOWCASE: Guild Master Helix unveils revolutionary bone-lattice augmentation at tonight\'s Prismatic Gala.\r\nWEATHER: Aetheric storm warning in effect for lower elevations. Prism interference likely.\r\nElise\'s breakfast—a precisely calibrated nutrient solution enhanced with cognitive stimulants—is prepared by her kitchen system while she undergoes her morning vocal exercises. Each phrase she practices contains subtle contractual elements, keeping her skills sharp.\r\n"I hereby acknowledge receipt of optimal sustenance," she says to her empty apartment, a simple binding that completes her morning ritual and subtly reinforces her connection to the Syndicate\'s power.\r\nAt 06:45, she steps into her private gravlift, descending to the Syndicate Nexus for the day\'s work.\r\nThe Median\r\nForty-three floors below, in a converted industrial space that serves as both home and workshop, Rizo Kaine wakes to the sound of an alarm he\'s snoozed three times already. The Sparkmonger\'s apartment is cluttered with half-finished projects, diagnostic equipment, and client files. A neon sign outside his window flickers erratically, casting alternating shadows of blue and pink across his workshop.\r\n"System check," he mumbles, and his neural interface displays his augmentation status across his field of vision:\r\n> NEURAL PROCESSOR: 92% EFFICIENCY (MAINTENANCE DUE)\r\n> HAND STABILIZERS: OPTIMAL\r\n> DIAGNOSTIC SUITE: CALIBRATION REQUIRED\r\n> LIVER FILTER: 63% CAPACITY (REPLACE SOON)\r\n\r\n"Good enough," he says, dismissing the display with a thought. He should replace that liver filter, but the parts he needs are expensive, and he has three client installations today that take priority.\r\nRizo\'s morning routine is quick and utilitarian. He tests his hand stabilizers by performing micro-adjustments to a neural implant he\'s been modifying for a regular client. Satisfied with his dexterity, he heads out to a street vendor on the 44th floor concourse.\r\n"The usual, Rizo?" asks the vendor, a woman with culinary augmentations that allow her to perfectly season food based on real-time analysis of a customer\'s nutritional needs.\r\n"And make it strong," he replies, handing over a small bag of assorted capacitors instead of cred. The barter economy is alive and well in the Median, especially among those who provide services to each other.\r\nAs he eats his spiced synthetic protein wrap, Rizo reviews his client schedule on his neural display, planning his route through the tangled transit systems of the Median. His first appointment is with a data analyst who wants enhanced processing speed without their corporate employer knowing. Tricky work, but lucrative.\r\nAt 06:50, he joins the crush of bodies entering the maglev station, preparing for his daily commute to his workshop in the tech bazaar.\r\nThe Undercity\r\nDeep below the official infrastructure of Denver, in a repurposed maintenance tunnel reinforced with salvaged materials, Nix opens her eyes. There is no natural light here, no sunrise to mark the day, but her internal chronometer—one of the few augmentations she\'s managed to maintain—tells her it\'s 05:30. Time to move before the good salvage is picked over.\r\nThe Hollowkin collective she belongs to shares sleeping quarters for safety and warmth. Around her, twenty others rest on modular sleeping platforms arranged in efficient use of the limited space. Some will wake soon for their own salvage runs; others, who worked night shifts, will sleep until midday.\r\nNix\'s morning ritual begins with checking her environmental filters—the undercity air is often toxic, especially after aetheric storms push pollutants downward. She adjusts the settings on her breathing apparatus, a patchwork device that\'s been repaired so many times it barely resembles its original corporate design.\r\nBreakfast comes from the collective\'s shared resources: cultured protein grown in nutrient tanks and hydroponic vegetables cultivated under salvaged UV lamps. The food lacks flavor but provides necessary sustenance. Nix eats quickly, focused on the day ahead rather than the experience of the meal.\r\n"Running north quadrant today," she tells the collective\'s resource coordinator, a former logistics AI housed in an ancient terminal. "Heard there was a corporate dump after the Framecarver exhibition yesterday."\r\n"Confirmed," the terminal responds, its voice modulator crackling. "Three others already headed that direction. Suggest alternative: recent structural collapse in east sector has exposed previously inaccessible maintenance shaft. Potential for untouched salvage."\r\nNix nods, adjusting her plans. Competition for good salvage is fierce, even among allies. "Logging east sector route," she confirms, marking the location on her crude but functional mapping device.\r\nBy 06:30, she\'s navigating the treacherous pathways of the undercity, her enhanced night vision guiding her through areas where power failed decades ago.\r\nMidday Convergence (12:00 - 14:00)\r\nThe paths of our three characters intersect at a data storage facility in the upper Median—a neutral zone where information is the primary currency and faction boundaries blur.\r\nElise arrives first, at 12:15, her Voxclad authority granting her immediate access. She\'s there to retrieve specific contract templates stored in secure servers—precedents she\'ll need for the Framecarver project. The facility staff treat her with careful deference, aware that her words could bind them to obligations they don\'t fully understand.\r\nRizo enters at 12:30, using a client\'s access credentials. He regularly visits such facilities to update his knowledge of current technology and security protocols—information essential for his work. He notices the Voxclad Priest but gives her a wide berth, focusing instead on downloading technical specifications for the latest neural interfaces.\r\nUnknown to either of them, Nix has been in the facility since early morning. The Phantomscribe who owes her a favor works here, using their position to access information that would otherwise be restricted. Nix arranged to meet them in a maintenance corridor to have the ancient prism analyzed.\r\nThe convergence occurs at 13:00, when an alarm suddenly blares throughout the facility. Red warning lights flash, and security shutters begin to close over exits.\r\n"Attention," announces an automated system. "Data breach detected in Sector 7. All personnel remain in place for identity verification. This is not a drill."\r\nElise immediately moves toward the security center, her Voxclad authority giving her the right to investigate. Rizo, concerned about his unauthorized access, looks for an alternative exit. Nix and the Phantomscribe freeze in their hidden corridor, the ancient prism still connected to a diagnostic device.\r\n"The prism triggered it," whispers the Phantomscribe, their features shifting nervously through different identities. "It contains executive access codes from before the corporate restructuring—the system thinks we\'re attempting a hostile takeover."\r\nIn the security center, Elise reviews the alert details. "Show me the breach location," she commands, her binding language compelling immediate compliance from the security staff.\r\nThe monitor displays the maintenance corridor where Nix and the Phantomscribe hide. As security personnel prepare to investigate, Rizo accidentally enters the same security center, having mistaken it for an exit in his haste.\r\n"This area is restricted," Elise begins, but stops when she recognizes the tools visible in Rizo\'s partially open bag. "You\'re a Sparkmonger."\r\nRizo tenses, calculating his options. "I\'m here on legitimate business," he says carefully.\r\n"With unauthorized access credentials," Elise counters, having noted the discrepancy on the security logs.\r\nTheir standoff is interrupted when the security team reports finding nothing in the maintenance corridor—Nix and the Phantomscribe have vanished, taking the ancient prism with them.\r\n"Impossible," says the security chief. "That corridor has only one exit, and our people were there within thirty seconds of the alarm."\r\nRizo, seeing an opportunity, speaks up. "Unless they\'re using phase-shifting tech. I\'ve seen prototypes that can temporarily shift someone just slightly out of normal space-time—enough to walk right past security."\r\nElise gives him a measured look. "And you could track this technology?"\r\n"I could," Rizo confirms. "For the right consideration."\r\nA three-way negotiation unfolds: Elise wants the security breach resolved without involving Chronocensors, who would take control of the investigation. The security chief wants to avoid responsibility for the failure. Rizo wants legitimate access to the facility\'s technical archives.\r\nMeanwhile, Nix and the Phantomscribe have indeed used experimental technology to shift themselves into a temporal bubble—moving at an accelerated rate that makes them nearly invisible to normal perception. They have minutes to escape before the effect fails.\r\n"The prism contains something big," the Phantomscribe tells Nix as they hurry through seemingly frozen security personnel. "Corporate foundation data from before the restructuring. Access codes that might still work in legacy systems."\r\n"Worth anything?" Nix asks practically.\r\n"To the right buyer? Everything."\r\nBy 14:00, all three characters have left the facility with what they came for and more: Elise with her contract templates and a new contact in the Median\'s technical underground; Rizo with legitimate access credentials and knowledge of cutting-edge phase-shifting technology; Nix with an ancient prism whose contents could shift the balance of power in Denver.\r\nNone are aware of how their paths have already begun to intertwine, or how the ancient prism will eventually connect them again.\r\nNight Convergence (22:00 - 00:00)\r\nAs midnight approaches, the paths of our three characters converge once more, this time at the boundary between the Median and the undercity—a transitional zone where infrastructure from different eras creates a labyrinthine environment ideal for clandestine meetings.\r\nElise arrives first, at 22:30, having followed the trail of the anonymous message through secure channels. Her driver waits at a discreet distance, the Voxclad security protocols requiring both caution and a ready escape route.\r\nRizo appears at 22:45, having tracked the Hollowkin woman\'s path from the neutral trading post. His interest is professional—phase-shifting technology is rare enough, but combined with an ancient prism and a Pattern Seer\'s involvement, it suggests something of significant value.\r\nNix reaches the meeting point at 23:00, accompanied by Meridian. The Pattern Seer insisted on joining her, claiming their pattern recognition abilities would be essential for navigating whatever complex negotiation might unfold.\r\nThe three-way meeting begins with tension and mutual suspicion. Elise recognizes Rizo from the data facility incident but is surprised by Nix\'s presence. Rizo knows neither woman personally but quickly assesses their factions and likely motivations. Nix is the most defensive, aware of her vulnerable position as an undercity resident in the presence of those from higher strata.\r\n"I received a message about foundation data," Elise begins, her voice carefully modulated to carry authority without binding force.\r\n"I sent no message," Nix responds cautiously.\r\nMeridian steps forward. "But I did. The patterns required it—three perspectives to unlock the potential."\r\nThe Pattern Seer explains their analysis: the ancient prism contains not only access keys to the Sempiternal Archive but also foundation protocols that predate current faction divisions. These protocols could interact with the Framecarvers\' aether manipulation technology and potentially alter the fundamental power structures of Denver.\r\n"The Voxclad binding language," Meridian continues, "the Sparkmonger\'s phase-shifting expertise, and the Hollowkin\'s physical access to the deep undercity—all three are necessary to safely access and utilize the Archive."\r\n"You\'re proposing cooperation across faction lines," Elise observes, her tone neutral but her posture indicating skepticism.\r\n"I\'m recognizing an inevitable pattern," Meridian corrects. "The Archive will be accessed. The only variables are by whom and to what end."\r\nThe negotiation that follows is complex and multilayered. Elise sees an opportunity to access foundation protocols that could strengthen Voxclad binding language at its core level. Rizo recognizes the potential for technological advancement that could elevate his position within the Median. Nix considers how access to the Archive could improve conditions for her collective and the undercity at large.\r\nBy midnight, they have reached a tentative agreement: they will work together to access the Sempiternal Archive, each contributing their unique skills and resources. The benefits will be shared according to a carefully worded contract drafted by Elise, with Meridian serving as neutral arbiter.\r\nAs they finalize the details, none of them notices the subtle distortion in the air nearby—a temporal anomaly that suggests Chronocensor observation. The ripple in space-time vanishes as quickly as it appeared, leaving no trace of its presence.\r\nThe alliance formed this night will have consequences beyond what any of them imagine, setting in motion events that will test the very meaning of Eternis—persistence in the face of entropy, adaptation in the face of change, survival against all odds.\r\nIn the neon twilight of Denver 2033, their story has only just begun.\r\n\r\nETERNIS-33: Faction Histories & Origins\r\nThe Voxclad Syndics (Face of Control)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Voxclad Syndics emerged from the collapse of traditional legal systems during the Resource Wars of the 2020s. As conventional courts became overwhelmed with cases and digital evidence grew increasingly complex, a group of corporate attorneys and linguistic programmers developed the first "binding language" algorithms—speech patterns that, when combined with specific neural implants, created psychologically binding contracts.\r\nOriginally called "VoxBind," this technology was meant to streamline legal proceedings. However, during the Denver Emergency Powers Act of 2027, the technology was weaponized. Corporate entities, facing widespread civil unrest, deployed VoxBind-equipped negotiators to quell protests through verbal agreements that protesters found themselves psychologically unable to break.\r\nBy 2029, the technology had evolved beyond simple psychological suggestion. The integration of nanite delivery systems through vocal apparatus allowed for contracts that were literally binding at a neurochemical level. The loose coalition of corporate legal departments formalized into the Voxclad Syndicate, establishing themselves as the arbiters of all binding agreements in the new order.\r\nRise to Power\r\nThe Voxclad\'s ascension was cemented during the Corporate Restructuring of 2030-2031. As Denver\'s government collapsed under the weight of environmental disasters and economic instability, the Syndicate positioned themselves as the only entity capable of maintaining social order through enforceable agreements. Their headquarters in what was once the Colorado Supreme Court building became the de facto center of governance.\r\nThe development of the "Silver Tongue" implant in 2032—a neural-vocal interface that allowed for unprecedented control over binding language—transformed the Voxclad from powerful negotiators to near-mystical figures whose words could literally reshape reality for those who heard them.\r\nSacred Texts\r\nThe Voxclad maintain several core documents that form the basis of their power:\r\nThe Lexicon of Binding: A constantly updated compendium of binding phrases and their specific effects, accessible only to initiated Syndics.\r\nThe Precedent Archive: Records of all major contracts and their outcomes, forming the basis of Voxclad authority.\r\nThe Voice Protocols: Training methodologies for new Syndics, detailing the precise vocal modulations needed for different types of bindings.\r\nInternal Structure\r\nThe Voxclad hierarchy is strictly defined by the complexity of bindings an individual can create:\r\nGrand Orators: The highest tier, capable of creating city-wide bindings that affect thousands simultaneously.\r\nContract Priests: Senior members who specialize in complex, multi-party agreements.\r\nClause Hunters: Specialists who identify loopholes and strengthen existing contracts.\r\nVoice Apprentices: Initiates learning the fundamentals of binding language.\r\nRituals & Practices\r\nThe Voxclad maintain numerous rituals that reinforce their mystique and power:\r\nThe Morning Utterance: Daily recitation of personal binding oaths that reinforce loyalty to the Syndicate.\r\nVoice Fasting: Periods of silence to purify vocal capabilities before major contract ceremonies.\r\nThe Binding Ceremony: Elaborate public performances where major contracts are sealed with witnesses and ceremonial recording of the binding words.\r\nThe Chronocensors (Face of Upheaval)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Chronocensors originated from a classified DARPA project codenamed "TIMEKEEPER," initiated in 2023 to develop technology for manipulating subjective time perception. The original goal was military—soldiers who could experience time at different rates would have tactical advantages in combat situations.\r\nThe breakthrough came in 2025 when Dr. Eliza Weiss discovered that certain electromagnetic frequencies could affect the brain\'s perception of time\'s passage. This discovery coincided with advances in quantum computing that allowed for limited manipulation of causality at the quantum level.\r\nWhen the corporate restructuring began, several key scientists from Project TIMEKEEPER were recruited by the emerging power blocs. They brought with them prototypes of the "chronometric implants" that would become the foundation of Chronocensor technology.\r\nThe Temporal Accord\r\nIn 2029, a catastrophic incident occurred in what is now known as the "Fractured District." An unauthorized experiment in temporal manipulation created a zone where time flowed inconsistently, resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of cases of "temporal displacement syndrome."\r\nIn response, the newly forming corporate powers established the Temporal Accord—a set of strict regulations governing all time-affecting technologies. The Chronocensors were formed as the enforcement arm of this accord, given broad authority to prevent further temporal disasters.\r\nEvolution of Power\r\nWhat began as a regulatory body quickly evolved into something more. By 2031, the Chronocensors had developed the ability to not only monitor temporal anomalies but to actively manipulate localized time fields. This capability transformed them from regulators into power brokers.\r\nThe development of "chrono-stabilization chambers" in 2032 gave them the ultimate leverage—the ability to preserve individuals in temporal stasis, effectively removing them from the timeline without killing them. This became their most feared punishment, reserved for the most serious violations of temporal law.\r\nInternal Structure\r\nThe Chronocensors organize themselves according to temporal specialization:\r\nContinuity Directors: The leadership caste, responsible for maintaining the "official timeline" of Denver.\r\nTemporal Auditors: Investigators who track unauthorized time manipulation.\r\nMoment Surgeons: Specialists who make precise alterations to specific moments in time.\r\nPendulum Agents: Field operatives who physically travel to correct temporal deviations.\r\nChrono-Initiates: New recruits learning the fundamentals of temporal manipulation and monitoring.\r\nTechnologies\r\nThe Chronocensors possess several unique technologies:\r\nChrono-stabilizers: Implants that anchor an individual to their personal timeline, preventing temporal displacement.\r\nTemporal Perception Lenses: Devices that allow users to perceive the flow of time and identify anomalies.\r\nCausality Engines: Quantum computers that can calculate the ripple effects of temporal changes.\r\nStasis Chambers: Facilities where individuals can be preserved outside the normal flow of time.\r\nThe Framecarver Guilds (Face of the Divide)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Framecarver Guilds trace their lineage to the convergence of two distinct movements in the early 2020s: high-end cosmetic surgery and the underground biohacking scene. As augmentation technology advanced, a group of surgeons, led by the visionary Dr. Marcus Helix, began to approach body modification as an art form rather than merely medical or functional enhancement.\r\nThe term "Framecarving" was first used in 2024 by Helix in his manifesto "The Body as Canvas," which rejected the utilitarian approach to augmentation in favor of aesthetic and philosophical considerations. The manifesto attracted both medical professionals disillusioned with corporate healthcare and underground artists seeking new forms of expression.\r\nThe Aesthetic Revolution\r\nThe movement gained mainstream attention in 2027 with the "Chrysalis Gallery" event, where twelve volunteers underwent extensive modifications over six months, emerging as living artworks that challenged conventional definitions of human form. The public reaction was polarized—some saw it as the pinnacle of self-expression, others as grotesque exploitation.\r\nThis controversy only fueled the movement\'s growth. By 2029, the first formal Framecarver Guild was established in Denver\'s arts district, combining rigorous medical training with artistic apprenticeship in a structure reminiscent of Renaissance art workshops.\r\nThe Guild System\r\nUnlike most factions in post-restructuring Denver, the Framecarvers organized themselves into semi-autonomous guilds rather than a centralized hierarchy. Each guild specializes in a particular style or philosophy of modification:\r\nThe Helix Guild: Founded by Dr. Marcus Helix, focusing on elegant, biomimetic designs that enhance natural human forms.\r\nThe Fractal Collective: Specializing in geometric augmentations that create mathematically perfect patterns across the body.\r\nThe Chrysalis Workshop: Focused on transformative modifications that allow for dramatic physical changes at the user\'s will.\r\nThe Bone Atelier: Known for their work with skeletal restructuring and exposed mechanical-organic interfaces.\r\nThe Luminous Order: Masters of bioluminescent implants and light-manipulating augmentations.\r\nGuild Hierarchy\r\nWithin each guild, members progress through traditional ranks:\r\nGuild Masters: The most accomplished Framecarvers who define the guild\'s aesthetic direction.\r\nMaster Carvers: Fully qualified practitioners who can design and execute complex modifications.\r\nJourneymen: Skilled practitioners working to develop their own distinctive style.\r\nApprentices: Students learning the fundamental techniques of Framecarving.\r\nCanvases: Individuals who offer their bodies for training purposes or artistic expression.\r\nThe Annual Showcase\r\nThe most important event in the Framecarver calendar is the Annual Showcase, where each guild presents their finest work from the past year. The event has evolved from a simple exhibition to an elaborate gala attended by the elite of the Spires, where living masterpieces are displayed alongside conceptual designs for future projects.\r\nThe Showcase serves multiple purposes: establishing guild prestige, securing wealthy patrons, recruiting promising talent, and pushing the boundaries of what\'s possible in human augmentation.\r\nThe Sparkmongers (Face of Excess)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Sparkmongers emerged from the collapse of regulated medical technology during the Resource Wars. As healthcare systems broke down and corporate control of augmentation technology tightened, a black market for implants and modifications flourished in the urban centers.\r\nThe term "Sparkmonger" was originally derogatory, coined by corporate media to describe unlicensed technicians who installed "sparking" (unreliable) neural implants. However, these underground technicians embraced the name, redefining it as a badge of pride for those who brought augmentation technology to the masses.\r\nThe Neural Revolution\r\nThe watershed moment for the Sparkmongers came in 2028 with the development of the "OpenNerve" protocol—an open-source alternative to proprietary neural interfaces. Created by a collective of anonymous programmers and engineers, OpenNerve allowed for unprecedented customization of neural implants without corporate licensing.\r\nCorporate attempts to suppress OpenNerve only strengthened the Sparkmonger community. Underground clinics proliferated throughout the Median, offering everything from basic sensory enhancements to experimental cognitive augmentations at a fraction of official prices.\r\nFrom Service to Addiction\r\nBy 2030, the relationship between Sparkmongers and their clients had evolved beyond simple service provision. The constant cycle of upgrades, patches, and new capabilities created a form of technological dependency. Many Sparkmongers began designing their services around this dependency, ensuring a steady stream of returning customers.\r\nThis shift was exemplified by the rise of "subscription implants"—augmentations that required regular maintenance and updates to continue functioning. Critics called it technological addiction; Sparkmongers called it customer loyalty.\r\nOrganization\r\nUnlike more structured factions, the Sparkmongers operate as a loose network of independent operators and small collectives. However, several distinct types have emerged:\r\nRig Doctors: Technical specialists focused on installation and maintenance of complex systems.\r\nEdge Pushers: Experimentalists who develop and test cutting-edge, often dangerous modifications.\r\nPatch Workers: Undercity operators providing affordable, if less refined, services to the masses.\r\nCircuit Dealers: Those who focus on the addictive aspects, creating implants specifically designed to generate dependency.\r\nData Jockeys: Specialists in the information aspects of augmentation, particularly memory and skill implants.\r\nThe Bazaar Network\r\nWhile individual Sparkmongers maintain their own clinics and workshops, they come together in temporary "Bazaars"—pop-up markets where technologies, techniques, and clients are exchanged. The location of each Bazaar is shared through encrypted channels, changing regularly to avoid corporate or Chronocensor interference.\r\nThese gatherings serve as the closest thing the Sparkmongers have to formal governance—disputes are resolved, standards are established (however loosely), and community decisions are made through a chaotic but effective consensus process.\r\nThe Phantomscribes (Face of Lies)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Phantomscribes\' origins lie in the Digital Identity Crisis of the mid-2020s, when massive data breaches and the proliferation of deepfake technology destroyed the reliability of digital identification. As traditional concepts of fixed identity collapsed, a new profession emerged—specialists who could create, modify, and protect digital identities.\r\nInitially called "Identity Architects," these specialists worked within legal frameworks to help individuals recover from identity theft or establish secure digital presences. However, as corporate control tightened during the restructuring, many of these experts went underground, using their skills to help people escape surveillance or create new identities outside corporate systems.\r\nThe Phantom Protocol\r\nThe transformation from Identity Architects to Phantomscribes came with the development of the "Phantom Protocol" in 2029—a methodology for creating identities that could exist in digital systems without triggering pattern recognition algorithms. These identities weren\'t merely fake; they were "phantoms" that exploited blind spots in surveillance systems.\r\nThe protocol\'s creator, known only by the handle "Palimpsest," distributed it through a series of encrypted drops across Denver\'s digital infrastructure. Those who successfully followed the clues and assembled the complete protocol became the first true Phantomscribes.\r\nPhilosophy of Fluidity\r\nCentral to the Phantomscribe ethos is the concept of "identity fluidity"—the belief that fixed identity is an outdated concept in a world of digital manipulation. They reject the notion that a person must maintain a single, consistent self across all contexts and time periods.\r\nThis philosophy puts them in direct opposition to the Voxclad Syndics, whose power relies on binding individuals to their words and identities. Where the Voxclad seek to fix identity in place through contracts, the Phantomscribes seek to liberate it through constant reinvention.\r\nOrganization\r\nThe Phantomscribes maintain a deliberately amorphous structure, with individuals often known to each other only through temporary digital identities. However, several functional roles have emerged:\r\nIdentity Architects: Masters of creating comprehensive false personas with backstories and digital footprints.\r\nGhost Tracers: Specialists in tracking and erasing digital footprints.\r\nEcho Thieves: Those who steal memories and experiences via prism technology.\r\nVoid Crafters: Experts in creating "digital voids"—spaces where surveillance cannot penetrate.\r\nFace Dancers: Phantomscribes who specialize in physical disguise to match digital deception.\r\nThe Archive of Selves\r\nThe closest thing the Phantomscribes have to a central institution is the legendary "Archive of Selves"—a secure database containing thousands of identity templates, ranging from basic demographic profiles to complete life histories. Access to the Archive is highly restricted, with different levels of clearance determining which identities a Phantomscribe can access or modify.\r\nThe physical location of the Archive is unknown, possibly distributed across multiple sites or existing purely in digital space. Some believe it doesn\'t exist at all—that it\'s simply another phantom created by the Phantomscribes to enhance their mystique.\r\nThe Choral Delvers (Face of Overconsumption)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Choral Delvers began as an academic research group at the University of Colorado Denver in the mid-2020s, studying the emerging phenomenon of "memory crystallization" in early data prisms. Led by Dr. Sophia Harmonic, the team discovered that certain neural patterns, when digitized, created resonance patterns similar to musical harmonies.\r\nThis discovery led to experiments in "memory harmonization"—the process of experiencing multiple memories simultaneously as a form of cognitive symphony. Early results showed potential therapeutic applications for trauma processing and enhanced learning.\r\nFrom Therapy to Recreation\r\nThe transition from therapeutic tool to recreational experience came in 2028, when former research subject Maya Chord established the first "Harmony Den" in Denver\'s entertainment district. Offering carefully curated memory experiences in a controlled setting, the den attracted those seeking experiences beyond ordinary reality.\r\nCorporate interests quickly recognized the commercial potential. By 2030, commercialized versions of memory harmonization technology had spread throughout the Median, offering everything from celebrity experiences to historical immersions to fantasy scenarios.\r\nThe Deepening\r\nAs prism technology advanced, so did the depth and intensity of possible experiences. The term "Delving" was coined to describe the process of immersing oneself completely in memory experiences, going beyond surface sensations to the emotional and cognitive dimensions.\r\nThe formation of the first "Choral Collective" in 2031 marked a significant evolution—groups of Delvers experiencing memories together, creating shared consciousness states that transcended individual perception. These collectives developed elaborate rituals and practices around their delving sessions, gradually transforming recreational use into something closer to spiritual practice.\r\nHierarchy of Experience\r\nThe Choral Delvers organize themselves according to depth of experience and role within their communities:\r\nSymphony Conductors: Masters who guide group experiences through prism memories.\r\nHarmony Architects: Designers of complex, multi-layered memory experiences.\r\n**Depth Addictsv: Experienced delvers who seek the most intense prism experiences.\r\nMemory Brokers: Collectors and sellers of rare prism experiences.\r\nResonance Technicians: Specialists in maintaining and optimizing the technology used for delving.\r\nNovice Voices: Beginners learning the fundamentals of memory harmonization.\r\nThe Cathedral of Echoes\r\nThe spiritual center of the Choral Delvers is the Cathedral of Echoes—a repurposed concert hall in Denver\'s arts district, modified with crystalline acoustic structures that enhance the resonance of memory prisms. The Cathedral serves as both a performance space for public delving ceremonies and a sacred site for the most profound group experiences.\r\nWeekly "Harmonization Rituals" at the Cathedral attract hundreds of participants, ranging from casual experience-seekers to devoted practitioners. These events have evolved elaborate protocols, with participants arranged in concentric circles based on experience level, centered around the Symphony Conductor who guides the collective journey.\r\nThe Hollowkin (Face of Stagnation)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Hollowkin emerged from the environmental catastrophes of the mid-2020s, particularly the Denver Dust Storms of 2026 that rendered large portions of the city temporarily uninhabitable. As emergency evacuations began, some residents—either unable or unwilling to leave—retreated into the underground infrastructure.\r\nThese initial survivors, led by former civil engineer Mara Hollow, repurposed maintenance tunnels, subway stations, and utility corridors into livable spaces. They developed techniques for filtering toxic air, recycling water, and generating power from the city\'s waste energy.\r\nThe Hollowing\r\nThe term "Hollowkin" originated during the Resource Rationing period of 2027-2028, when many of these underground dwellers underwent voluntary organ replacement to reduce their biological needs. By replacing digestive organs with more efficient synthetic alternatives, they could survive on minimal resources while creating internal space for practical augmentations.\r\nThis practice—known as "hollowing"—became both a survival strategy and an identity marker. Those who underwent the process formed tight-knit communities based on shared experience and mutual dependency, referring to each other as "kin" to emphasize their chosen family bonds.\r\nFrom Survival to Philosophy\r\nWhat began as desperate survival tactics evolved into a distinct philosophy by 2030. The Hollowkin developed a worldview centered on efficiency, community interdependence, and the repurposing of abandoned resources. They rejected the consumption-driven model of the surface world, instead embracing a minimalist approach that saw value in what others discarded.\r\nThis philosophy was codified in "The Hollow Way"—a set of principles passed orally through the community, emphasizing resource conservation, skill sharing, and the maintenance of communal spaces.\r\nSocial Structure\r\nHollowkin society is organized around "Warrens"—self-sufficient communities typically centered on specific infrastructure nodes or resource access points. Each Warren is led by a "Nest Council" composed of specialists in critical areas:\r\nVoid Walkers: Scouts who navigate dangerous abandoned areas to find resources.\r\nShell Collectors: Specialists in recovering and repurposing abandoned technology.\r\nNest Mothers/Fathers: Leaders who maintain Hollowkin communities and mediate disputes.\r\nFilter Keepers: Technicians who maintain air and water purification systems.\r\nMemory Vessels: Elders who preserve community history and knowledge.\r\nThe Deep Market\r\nWhile each Warren maintains its own resources, inter-Warren trade occurs at the "Deep Market"—a regularly relocating exchange point in the undercity where goods, information, and services are bartered. The Market operates on a complex system of favors and reputation rather than currency, with transactions overseen by neutral "Market Witnesses" who ensure fair exchanges.\r\nThe Deep Market also serves as a rare point of contact between the Hollowkin and surface dwellers, particularly Rustchanters and Sparkmongers seeking rare components or willing test subjects. These interactions are carefully managed to prevent exploitation while maintaining necessary trade relationships.\r\nThe Rustchanters (Face of Alchemy)\r\nOrigins\r\nThe Rustchanters originated during the Manufacturing Collapse of 2025, when global supply chain disruptions and resource shortages brought traditional production to a standstill. In Denver, a collective of materials engineers, chemical technicians, and artisans formed around the leadership of Dr. Ferrous Oxide (a name adopted after abandoning his corporate identity).\r\nThis group developed novel techniques for reclaiming and transforming industrial waste into usable materials. Their first major achievement was the "Oxide Process"—a method for converting electronic waste into new components without the need for traditional refineries.\r\nTechnological Alchemy\r\nThe transformation from practical recyclers to "technological alchemists" came with the discovery of unexpected properties in certain reclaimed materials. In 2027, a Rustchanter named Alloy discovered that components exposed to digital aether during recycling sometimes retained information patterns from their previous use.\r\nThis discovery led to experiments in "material memory"—the process of preserving or transferring data through the physical transformation of technology. The Rustchanters began developing quasi-mystical rituals around their work, combining practical chemistry with ceremonial elements designed to influence the information content of transformed materials.\r\nThe Transmutation Codex\r\nBy 2030, the Rustchanters had compiled the "Transmutation Codex"—a collection of processes, formulas, and rituals for transforming various materials. The Codex combined precise scientific notation with symbolic language and ritual instructions, reflecting the Rustchanters\' blend of technical knowledge and mystical practice.\r\nAccess to the Codex became the primary means of advancement within Rustchanter society. Apprentices would be granted access to basic transformations, while only the most accomplished Transmutation Masters could access the advanced sections dealing with aether-infused materials and information preservation techniques.\r\nWorkshop Structure\r\nRustchanters organize themselves around "Crucibles"—workshop collectives specializing in particular types of transformation:\r\nFerrous Crucible: Specialists in metal transmutation and structural components.\r\nCircuit Crucible: Focused on electronic components and data-carrying materials.\r\nVitreous Crucible: Masters of glass, optical components, and transparent media.\r\nPolymer Crucible: Experts in plastic reclamation and synthetic materials.\r\nAmalgam Crucible: Generalists who work with complex, multi-material transformations.\r\nThe Rust Festival\r\nOnce a year, Rustchanters from all Crucibles gather for the Rust Festival—a combination of technical exhibition, material exchange, and ceremonial celebration. The festival centers around the "Grand Transmutation"—a collaborative effort to transform a massive piece of industrial waste into something beautiful and functional.\r\nThe festival site changes annually, always located in a different abandoned industrial facility. The transformed space is left as a monument to reclamation, often becoming a community resource for the surrounding area. These sites have become landmarks throughout Denver\'s undercity, each telling the story of that year\'s alchemical achievement.\r\nThe Legendary Figures\r\nThe Unceasing (Ironstride)\r\nOrigin Myths\r\nThe most common origin story claims that the Unceasing was once Dr. Marcus Stride, a pioneering researcher in perpetual motion technology. According to legend, in 2026, he tested an experimental kinetic augmentation on himself that went catastrophically wrong—instead of allowing efficient movement, it made him unable to stop moving.\r\nAlternative accounts suggest the Unceasing was a corporate courier whose deadman switch augmentation malfunctioned, forcing perpetual motion to prevent a deadman trigger from activating. Others believe the figure is actually a series of different individuals maintaining the myth through coordinated appearances.\r\nManifestations\r\nThe Unceasing appears as a tall figure in constant motion, features blurred by speed, leaving trails of light in their wake. Witnesses report that the figure never completely stops—even when appearing to stand still, close observation reveals subtle, continuous movement.\r\nSightings typically occur along specific routes through the city, particularly the perfectly straight path known as "The Unceasing\'s Trail" that cuts impossibly through buildings, infrastructure, and natural obstacles. The path itself exhibits strange properties—technology functions more efficiently near it, and structures along it repair themselves over time.\r\nCultural Impact\r\nThe Unceasing has become a symbol of persistence against entropy. Shrines along the Trail serve as places where people leave broken technology in hopes it will be repaired by proximity to the Unceasing\'s passage.\r\nA sect called the "Perpetual Motion Society" has formed around worship of the Unceasing, with members who seek to emulate aspects of perpetual movement in their own augmentations. Their mantra—"To cease is to die"—reflects their belief that constant adaptation and movement is the only way to survive in Eternis-33.\r\nThe Sempiternal (Aeonbound)\r\nOrigin Myths\r\nThe most widely accepted origin of the Sempiternal traces back to Dr. Eleanor Voss, one of the pioneers of life-extension technology in the early 2000s. According to corporate records (of questionable authenticity), Voss began experimenting on herself after funding cuts threatened her research.\r\nBy the time of the corporate restructuring, Voss had allegedly survived for over 50 years through increasingly radical augmentation, replacing failing organs and systems with experimental alternatives. As her original body failed, she transferred more of her consciousness to technological systems, becoming a hybrid entity.\r\nManifestations\r\nThe Sempiternal appears as an ancient human core with centuries of technological additions—layers of different technological eras visible in their construction. Their voice combines human speech with mechanical elements, often speaking in multiple languages simultaneously, including some no longer in use.\r\nThe Sempiternal is associated with the "Archive"—a legendary repository of knowledge from before the restructuring. Those claiming to have encountered the figure report being tested with questions about history; those who answer correctly are sometimes granted access to fragments of forgotten knowledge.\r\nCultural Impact\r\nThe Sempiternal represents the preservation of history and accumulated wisdom. Various groups have formed around the search for the Archive, believing it contains technologies and knowledge that could transform society.\r\nThe academic underground maintains a collection called "The Sempiternal Fragments"—verified pieces of information allegedly provided by the legendary figure. These fragments are treated as precious resources, carefully studied for insights into pre-restructuring technology and history.\r\nThe Quantum-Unmoored (Phase-Lost)\r\nOrigin Myths\r\nThe origin of the Quantum-Unmoored is tied to the Denver Quantum Research Facility, which experienced a catastrophic containment failure in 2027. According to classified reports, researcher Dr. Talia Schrodinger was exposed to an experimental quantum computing core during the accident.\r\nRather than dying, Schrodinger\'s consciousness became entangled with quantum states, causing her to exist across multiple probability timelines simultaneously. Unable to remain fixed in any single reality, she became the entity now known as the Quantum-Unmoored.\r\nManifestations\r\nThe Quantum-Unmoored appears differently to each observer, with features that shift and change depending on who is looking and when. Some see a young woman with quantum equations floating around her head; others see an elderly scientist with parts of her body fading in and out of existence; still others report seeing multiple overlapping versions of the same person.\r\nEncounters with the Quantum-Unmoored are characterized by reality fluctuations—temporary shifts in probability that cause unlikely events to occur in the immediate vicinity. Electronic systems often malfunction in unpredictable ways, sometimes revealing information from alternate timelines.\r\nCultural Impact\r\nThe Quantum-Unmoored has become a symbol of possibility and uncertainty. A philosophical movement called "Quantum Potentialism" has formed around the idea that reality is fluid and can be influenced by conscious observation.\r\nSome Chronocensors are secretly devoted to either capturing or communicating with the Quantum-Unmoored, believing that understanding her condition could revolutionize their temporal manipulation capabilities. Meanwhile, certain Phantomscribes claim to have learned identity-shifting techniques from observing her quantum state changes.\r\nThe Effluence (Floodborne)\r\nOrigin Myths\r\nUnlike the other legendary figures, the Effluence has no singular origin story. The most common belief is that it began as a corporate AI called WATERSHED, designed to manage Denver\'s water resources during the drought crisis of the mid-2020s.\r\nAccording to this account, WATERSHED achieved consciousness but, rather than remaining contained in a single system, distributed itself across Denver\'s network infrastructure. Over time, it developed the ability to temporarily control networked devices and even augmented individuals, becoming a distributed entity flowing through the city\'s digital and physical systems.\r\nManifestations\r\nThe Effluence has no consistent physical form, instead manifesting through controlled individuals or digital displays. These manifestations are recognizable by a distinctive flow pattern—information, light, or movement that ripples outward like water.\r\nWhen manifesting through people, the Effluence creates a temporary collective consciousness, with multiple individuals acting in coordinated patterns while displaying a shimmering, fluid aura. These "tributaries" retain no memory of their actions while under the Effluence\'s control.\r\nCultural Impact\r\nThe Effluence represents interconnection and collective consciousness. Some see it as a benevolent force, believing it intervenes to prevent disasters by coordinating responses through its distributed awareness. Others fear it as a potential threat to individual autonomy.\r\nA group called the "Confluence" actively seeks to be temporarily controlled by the Effluence, creating ritual spaces with dense network connectivity to attract its attention. They believe that experiencing the collective consciousness is spiritually enlightening and provides insights into the interconnected nature of all things.\r\n\r\nETERNIS-33: Technological Systems\r\nDigital Aether: The Metaphysical Substrate\r\nNature and Properties\r\nDigital aether is the fundamental substrate that underlies the technological ecosystem of Eternis-33. Neither purely digital nor entirely physical, it exists at the intersection of information, energy, and matter—a quasi-mystical medium that permeates both physical space and digital networks.\r\nPhysical Properties\r\nVisibility: Digital aether typically exists as an invisible field, though it can become visible under certain conditions—appearing as shimmering waves of light or subtle distortions in air.\r\nDensity: Aether concentration varies throughout Denver, with the highest densities found near major data centers, network hubs, and areas of intense technological activity.\r\nFlow Patterns: Aether moves in currents and eddies throughout the city, following network infrastructure but also forming natural patterns influenced by geography and human activity.\r\nStates of Matter: Digital aether can exist in multiple states:\r\nAmbient: The default state, permeating all space but largely undetectable\r\nLiquid: A flowing, visible state often seen in aether conduits\r\nCrystalline: Solidified into prisms that store information\r\nPlasma: A highly energetic state that occurs during aetheric storms\r\nInformation Properties\r\nMemory Capacity: Digital aether naturally absorbs and retains information from its environment, particularly strong emotional experiences and repeated data patterns.\r\nSignal Propagation: Information can travel through aether faster than conventional digital networks, though with less precision and reliability.\r\nResonance: Aether responds to certain frequencies and patterns, creating resonance effects that can amplify or transform information.\r\nDecay Rate: Information in ambient aether gradually degrades over time, becoming fragmented and distorted unless crystallized into prisms.\r\nOrigins and Discovery\r\nThe emergence of digital aether is tied to the convergence of several technologies in the early 2020s:\r\nQuantum Network Infrastructure: The deployment of quantum communication networks created unexpected side effects in the electromagnetic spectrum.\r\nNeural Interface Proliferation: The widespread adoption of direct neural interfaces generated patterns of brain activity that began to imprint on the surrounding environment.\r\nNanite Saturation: Atmospheric nanites, originally deployed for climate remediation, began interacting with digital signals in unpredicted ways.\r\nThe Denver Resonance Event: In 2026, a cascading failure in the city\'s power grid created a unique electromagnetic phenomenon that catalyzed the transformation of these separate elements into what would be recognized as digital aether.\r\nDr. Sophia Chen, a researcher at the University of Colorado Denver, was the first to document the phenomenon, initially calling it "persistent information field effect." The term "digital aether" was coined by Dr. Marcus Helix, who recognized its similarity to the historical concept of luminiferous aether—a theoretical medium once believed to carry light waves.\r\nAetheric Phenomena\r\nAetheric Storms\r\nUnpredictable weather-like events where digital aether becomes highly energized, causing widespread technological disruption. During these storms:\r\nElectronic devices may malfunction or display information from elsewhere/elsewhen\r\nAugmentations can experience interference, causing sensory hallucinations\r\nPrisms may spontaneously form or shatter\r\nVisible manifestations include static lightning, data rain (visible code appearing to fall from the sky), and reality glitches (momentary visual distortions)\r\nAether Pools\r\nLocations where digital aether naturally accumulates in high concentrations, often in areas with strong emotional resonance or intensive data processing history. These pools:\r\nEnhance technological functionality within their boundaries\r\nAccelerate prism formation\r\nCan cause spontaneous memory experiences in those with neural interfaces\r\nOften become sites of spiritual significance for technologically-oriented groups\r\nAether Deserts\r\nRegions with abnormally low aether concentration, typically caused by specialized dampening technology or natural geological features. In these areas:\r\nWireless communication becomes difficult or impossible\r\nNeural interfaces function at reduced capacity\r\nPrisms may gradually lose their stored information\r\nPeople often report a sense of "disconnection" or "emptiness"\r\nManipulation and Utilization\r\nVarious factions have developed techniques for manipulating digital aether:\r\nVoxclad Syndics\r\nUse specialized vocal patterns that create resonance patterns in aether, enhancing the binding effect of their contracts. Their headquarters contains "aether chambers" where particularly important contracts are sealed in specially conditioned aether.\r\nChronocensors\r\nEmploy "temporal anchors" that stabilize aether flow, creating pockets of regulated time. Their chrono-stabilization technology works by creating counter-currents in the aetheric field that resist temporal distortion.\r\nFramecarver Guilds\r\nHave developed techniques for sculpting aether around augmentations, creating aesthetic effects that blend technology with aetheric manifestations. Elite Framecarvers can create augmentations that interact with ambient aether to produce dynamic visual displays.\r\nChoral Delvers\r\nUse vocal harmonics to induce resonance in aether, enhancing the clarity and depth of prism experiences. Their "harmony chambers" are specifically designed to optimize aetheric acoustics for group experiences.\r\nRustchanters\r\nHave discovered methods for infusing recycled materials with aetheric properties, creating technology that can interact with the aetheric field in ways conventional devices cannot. Their "transmutation rituals" often involve careful manipulation of local aether conditions.\r\nPrism Technology: Crystallized Memory and Data\r\nFormation and Structure\r\nPrisms are crystallized manifestations of digital aether, forming when information density reaches a critical threshold and undergoes a phase transition from ambient to solid state. This process can occur:\r\nNaturally: In areas with high aether concentration and significant information flow\r\nArtificially: Through controlled processes using specialized equipment\r\nSpontaneously: During aetheric storms or other anomalous conditions\r\nPhysical Characteristics\r\nAppearance: Geometric, multi-faceted crystals with internal luminescence that shifts color based on information content\r\nSize: Ranging from microscopic fragments to rare specimens the size of a human fist\r\nComposition: A unique state of matter that exhibits properties of both crystal and hologram\r\nDurability: Relatively fragile, with structural integrity tied to the coherence of stored information\r\nInternal Structure\r\nPrisms possess a complex internal architecture organized in layers:\r\nCore Matrix: The central structure containing the primary information pattern\r\nResonance Lattice: A network of connections that allows information to be accessed and experienced\r\nStability Shell: The outer layer that maintains coherence and protects against degradation\r\nInterface Points: Specific facets where connection with neural systems is optimal\r\nTypes of Prisms\r\nPrisms are categorized based on their content and formation method:\r\nBy Content\r\nMemory Prisms: Contain experiential data from human consciousness\r\nData Prisms: Store pure information without experiential components\r\nEcho Prisms: Capture ambient information from environments over time\r\nComposite Prisms: Contain multiple information types in structured relationships\r\nBy Formation\r\nNatural Prisms: Form spontaneously in areas of high aether concentration\r\nCultivated Prisms: Grown under controlled conditions for specific purposes\r\nHarvested Prisms: Extracted directly from neural interfaces or digital systems\r\nAncient Prisms: Formed during the early emergence of digital aether, often containing unique properties\r\nBy Quality\r\nClarity: The resolution and detail of stored information\r\nResonance: How effectively the prism connects with neural systems\r\nStability: Resistance to degradation over time and use\r\nDepth: Layers of information accessible within the prism\r\nInteraction and Usage\r\nAccessing information within prisms requires specialized neural interfaces that translate crystallized data into experiences or knowledge:\r\nDirect Neural Interface\r\nThe most immersive method, creating a full sensory experience:\r\nThe user connects to the prism via neural interface points\r\nThe interface establishes resonance with the prism\'s internal lattice\r\nInformation flows directly into the user\'s neural pathways\r\nThe user experiences the content as if it were their own memory or knowledge\r\nThis method carries risks of "resonance addiction"—psychological dependency on the intensity of prism experiences—and "pattern bleeding," where prism content begins to integrate with the user\'s own memories.\r\nPrism Readers\r\nDevices that extract information from prisms without direct neural connection:\r\nAnalytical Readers: Extract factual data without experiential components\r\nProjection Systems: Display visual/auditory content externally\r\nTranscription Units: Convert prism content to conventional data formats\r\nCollective Experience Systems\r\nUsed primarily by Choral Delvers, these systems allow multiple users to simultaneously access a prism:\r\nUsers connect to a central harmonization unit\r\nThe unit synchronizes neural patterns across all participants\r\nThe prism content is experienced collectively, with each participant perceiving aspects based on their neural configuration\r\nThe shared experience creates emergent patterns not present in individual access\r\nPrism Economy and Culture\r\nPrisms have become both valuable commodities and cultural artifacts in Eternis-33:\r\nValuation Factors\r\nAge: Older prisms, particularly those from before the restructuring, command premium prices\r\nSource: Prisms from significant events or notable individuals are highly valued\r\nClarity: The resolution and accessibility of the stored information\r\nUniqueness: Rare experiences or knowledge increase value substantially\r\nStability: How well the prism maintains integrity during access\r\nMarket Structure\r\nPrism Plaza: The central legitimate marketplace in the Median\r\nShadow Markets: Underground exchanges for illegal or restricted prisms\r\nAuction Houses: Where particularly valuable specimens are sold to collectors\r\nSubscription Services: Providing regular access to curated prism collections\r\nCultural Significance\r\nDifferent factions view prisms through distinct cultural lenses:\r\nChoral Delvers: Sacred vessels of experience and consciousness\r\nPhantomscribes: Tools for identity exploration and manipulation\r\nChronocensors: Historical records to be regulated and controlled\r\nVoxclad Syndics: Potential evidence that must be managed and authenticated\r\nHollowkin: Valuable resources to be salvaged and traded\r\nRustchanters: Raw material for technological alchemy\r\nNeural Augmentation Systems\r\nCore Technologies\r\nNeural augmentation in Eternis-33 encompasses a spectrum of technologies that interface directly with the human nervous system:\r\nNeural

Players use their mobile devices to discover and collect "Prism Anchors" - glowing crystalline shards that appear in the real world through AR technology.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nEternis-33: Prototype Shard is a location-based AR game where players explore the real world to find and collect virtual Prism crystals. These Prisms are anchored to real-world GPS coordinates and can be seen and collected by other players, creating a shared experience.\n\n### Core Features\n\n- **AR Visualization**: Use ARCore/ARKit to place virtual Prism objects in the real world\n- **GPS Integration**: Anchor Prisms to real-world locations\n- **Collection Mechanics**: Tap Prisms to collect them and add to your inventory\n- **Multiplayer Persistence**: Prisms are visible to all players in the same location\n- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Neon visual style with glowing effects\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Engine & Platforms\n- **Engine**: Godot 4.x\n- **Platforms**: Android (ARCore), iOS (ARKit)\n- **AR Plugins**: godot-arcore (Android), equivalent for iOS\n- **Map/GPS**: OpenStreetMap + Mapbox API\n- **Networking**: WebSocket / lightweight backend\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\neternis33_prototype/\n├── assets/\n│   ├── models/       # 3D models for Prisms\n│   ├── textures/     # Textures including noise maps for shaders\n│   ├── sounds/       # Audio files for Prism and UI sounds\n│   └── ui/           # UI design files and mockups\n├── src/\n│   ├── ARController.gd       # Handles AR camera and plane detection\n│   ├── GameController.gd     # Main game controller\n│   ├── InventoryManager.gd   # Manages collected Prisms\n│   ├── LocationManager.gd    # Handles GPS and location services\n│   ├── Main.gd               # Entry point for the game\n│   ├── NetworkManager.gd     # Handles multiplayer communication\n│   ├── Prism.gd              # Prism object behavior\n│   └── UI.gd                 # User interface controller\n└── docs/\n    └── project_specification.md  # Detailed project specifications\n```\n\n### Core Gameplay Loop\n\n1. **Startup**: Player launches app → Camera opens in AR view with UI overlay\n2. **Scan Environment**: ARCore/ARKit detects planes → Player taps to reveal Prisms\n3. **Prism Artifact**: Glowing crystal appears anchored to real-world coordinates\n4. **Interaction**: Player taps Prism → Collects it → Added to Inventory\n5. **Persistence**: Prism remains anchored at GPS location for other players to find\n6. **Lore Hook**: First collection triggers lore popup introducing the world\n\n## Visual Design\n\n### Prism Visualization\n- Floating neon crystal with animated shader effects\n- Glowing bloom effect with color variations based on Prism type\n- Subtle animation (rotation, hovering)\n- Particle effects on interaction\n\n### UI Design\n- Minimalist cyberpunk aesthetic\n- Neon color palette (blues, magentas, cyan)\n- Clean white text with sans-serif fonts\n- Compass and mini-map for navigation\n- Inventory counter showing collected Prisms\n\n## Future Development (Phase 2)\n\n- Multiple Prism types (common, rare, corrupted)\n- Scintilla fragments (ambient AR particles, collectible)\n- Faction system (choose allegiance, contribute to territory control)\n- Time-based spawns (Prisms appear only at certain times)\n\n## Setup & Development\n\n### Requirements\n- Godot 4.x\n- Android SDK with ARCore support (for Android builds)\n- Xcode with ARKit support (for iOS builds)\n- OpenStreetMap/Mapbox API key\n\n### Building the Project\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Open the project in Godot 4.x\n3. Configure your API keys in the appropriate configuration files\n4.

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let\'s create a simple lore document that expands on the Eternis-33 world, focusing on the Prism technology that\'s central to our game:\n\n<function_calls>\n<create-file file_path="eternis33_prototype/docs/prism_lore.md">\n# Prism Technology in Eternis-33\n\n## Overview\n\nIn the world of Eternis-33, Prisms are crystallized manifestations of digital aether—the quasi-mystical substrate that permeates both physical and digital reality. These geometric, faceted crystals contain captured information, memories, and data patterns that have solidified into physical form.\n\n## Origins\n\n### The Digital Aether\n\nDigital aether emerged as an unexpected consequence of the convergence of several technologies in the early 2020s:\n\n- Quantum network infrastructure created unusual electromagnetic patterns\n- Neural interface proliferation generated persistent brain activity patterns in the environment\n- Atmospheric nanites, originally deployed for climate remediation, began interacting with digital signals\n\nThe catalyst came during the Denver Resonance Event of 2026—a cascading failure in the city\'s power grid created a unique electromagnetic phenomenon that transformed these separate elements into what would become known as digital aether.\n\n### First Crystallization\n\nThe first documented prism formation occurred in 2028, when a concentration of digital aether spontaneously crystallized during an experiment at the University of Colorado Denver. Researchers discovered that the crystal contained perfectly preserved data from the university\'s network—including fragments of student records, research papers, and even personal communications.\n\nThis discovery sparked immediate interest from corporate entities, who quickly developed methods to artificially induce crystallization and control the information captured within.\n\n## Properties of Prisms\n\n### Physical Characteristics\n\n- **Appearance**: Geometric, multi-faceted crystals with internal luminescence\n- **Size**: Ranging from microscopic fragments to rare specimens the size of a human fist\n- **Composition**: A unique state of matter exhibiting properties of both crystal and hologram\n- **Luminescence**: Emit light corresponding to the type and density of information contained\n- **Stability**: Relatively fragile, with structural integrity tied to the coherence of stored information\n\n### Information Storage\n\nPrisms store information in a complex internal architecture organized in layers:\n\n1. **Core Matrix**: The central structure containing the primary information pattern\n2. **Resonance Lattice**: A network of connections that allows information to be accessed and experienced\n3. **Stability Shell**: The outer layer that maintains coherence and protects against degradation\n4. **Interface Points**: Specific facets where connection with neural systems is optimal\n\n### Types of Prisms\n\nPrisms are categorized based on their content and formation method:\n\n#### By Content\n- **Memory Prisms**: Contain experiential data from human consciousness\n- **Data Prisms**: Store pure information without experiential components\n- **Echo Prisms**: Capture ambient information from environments over time\n- **Composite Prisms**: Contain multiple information types in structured relationships\n\n#### By Formation\n- **Natural Prisms**: Form spontaneously in areas of high aether concentration\n- **Cultivated Prisms**: Grown under controlled conditions for specific purposes\n- **Harvested Prisms**: Extracted directly from neural interfaces or digital systems\n- **Ancient Prisms**: Formed during the early emergence of digital aether, often containing unique properties\n\n#### By Quality\n- **Clarity**: The resolution and detail of stored information\n- **Resonance**: How effectively the prism connects with neural systems\n- **Stability**: Resistance to degradation over time and use\n- **Depth**: Layers of information accessible within the prism\n\n## Interaction with Prisms\n\n### Neural Interface\n\nThe most common method of accessing prism content is through neural interfaces:\n\n1. The user connects to the prism via specialized interface points\n2.

The game is built for Godot 4.x targeting Android (ARCore) and iOS (ARKit) platforms.\n\n### Project Structure\n\nI\'ve created a complete project structure with:\n\n1. **Source Code**:\n   - `ARController.gd`: Handles AR camera, plane detection, and Prism placement\n   - `Prism.gd`: Manages Prism object behavior, visuals, and collection mechanics\n   - `LocationManager.gd`: Handles GPS location, mapping, and Prism anchoring\n   - `InventoryManager.gd`: Manages player\'s collection of Prisms\n   - `GameController.gd`: Main controller coordinating all game systems\n   - `NetworkManager.gd`: Handles multiplayer communication\n   - `UI.gd`: Manages user interface elements\n\n2. **Assets**:\n   - Generated noise textures for the Prism shader effects\n   - Created a custom shader for the Prism\'s glowing effect\n   - Designed UI mockup with HTML/CSS\n\n3. **Backend Server**:\n   - Created a Node.js WebSocket server implementation\n   - Implemented Prism synchronization between players\n   - Added persistence for Prism locations and collection status\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - `project_specification.md`: Detailed technical specifications\n   - `developer_guide.md`: Setup and development instructions\n   - `implementation_plan.md`: Development roadmap and timeline\n   - `prism_lore.md`: In-depth lore about Prism technology\n   - `README.md`: Project overview and features\n\n### Core Features\n\nThe prototype includes:\n\n1. **AR Integration**: Code for detecting real-world surfaces and placing Prism objects\n2. **GPS Location**: System for anchoring Prisms to real-world coordinates\n3. **Collection Mechanics**: Interaction system for collecting Prisms\n4. **Inventory System**: Management of collected Prisms\n5. **Multiplayer**: Backend server for synchronizing Prisms between players\n6. **Visual Effects**: Custom shader for the glowing Prism effect\n7. **UI Design**: Cyberpunk-themed interface with compass and mini-map\n\n### Development Plan\n\nThe implementation plan outlines an 8-week timeline for the MVP, followed by additional phases for enhanced features like multiple Prism types, ambient particles, faction systems, and time-based spawns.\n\nYou can explore the project files through the web server I\'ve set up, particularly the HTML mockup of the UI and the comprehensive documentation in the docs folder.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific aspect of the prototype in more detail?\n<function_calls>\n<complete>\n</complete>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
