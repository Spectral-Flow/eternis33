The game is built for Godot 4.x targeting Android (ARCore) and iOS (ARKit) platforms.\n\n### Project Structure\n\nI\'ve created a complete project structure with:\n\n1. **Source Code**:\n   - `ARController.gd`: Handles AR camera, plane detection, and Prism placement\n   - `Prism.gd`: Manages Prism object behavior, visuals, and collection mechanics\n   - `LocationManager.gd`: Handles GPS location, mapping, and Prism anchoring\n   - `InventoryManager.gd`: Manages player\'s collection of Prisms\n   - `GameController.gd`: Main controller coordinating all game systems\n   - `NetworkManager.gd`: Handles multiplayer communication\n   - `UI.gd`: Manages user interface elements\n\n2. **Assets**:\n   - Generated noise textures for the Prism shader effects\n   - Created a custom shader for the Prism\'s glowing effect\n   - Designed UI mockup with HTML/CSS\n\n3. **Backend Server**:\n   - Created a Node.js WebSocket server implementation\n   - Implemented Prism synchronization between players\n   - Added persistence for Prism locations and collection status\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - `project_specification.md`: Detailed technical specifications\n   - `developer_guide.md`: Setup and development instructions\n   - `implementation_plan.md`: Development roadmap and timeline\n   - `prism_lore.md`: In-depth lore about Prism technology\n   - `README.md`: Project overview and features\n\n### Core Features\n\nThe prototype includes:\n\n1. **AR Integration**: Code for detecting real-world surfaces and placing Prism objects\n2. **GPS Location**: System for anchoring Prisms to real-world coordinates\n3. **Collection Mechanics**: Interaction system for collecting Prisms\n4. **Inventory System**: Management of collected Prisms\n5. **Multiplayer**: Backend server for synchronizing Prisms between players\n6. **Visual Effects**: Custom shader for the glowing Prism effect\n7. **UI Design**: Cyberpunk-themed interface with compass and mini-map\n\n### Development Plan\n\nThe implementation plan outlines an 8-week timeline for the MVP, followed by additional phases for enhanced features like multiple Prism types, ambient particles, faction systems, and time-based spawns.\n\nYou can explore the project files through the web server I\'ve set up, particularly the HTML mockup of the UI and the comprehensive documentation in the docs folder.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific aspect of the prototype in more detail?\n<function_calls>\n<complete>\n</complete>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
