These geometric, faceted crystals contain captured information, memories, and data patterns that have solidified into physical form.\n\n## Origins\n\n### The Digital Aether\n\nDigital aether emerged as an unexpected consequence of the convergence of several technologies in the early 2020s:\n\n- Quantum network infrastructure created unusual electromagnetic patterns\n- Neural interface proliferation generated persistent brain activity patterns in the environment\n- Atmospheric nanites, originally deployed for climate remediation, began interacting with digital signals\n\nThe catalyst came during the Denver Resonance Event of 2026—a cascading failure in the city\'s power grid created a unique electromagnetic phenomenon that transformed these separate elements into what would become known as digital aether.\n\n### First Crystallization\n\nThe first documented prism formation occurred in 2028, when a concentration of digital aether spontaneously crystallized during an experiment at the University of Colorado Denver. Researchers discovered that the crystal contained perfectly preserved data from the university\'s network—including fragments of student records, research papers, and even personal communications.\n\nThis discovery sparked immediate interest from corporate entities, who quickly developed methods to artificially induce crystallization and control the information captured within.\n\n## Properties of Prisms\n\n### Physical Characteristics\n\n- **Appearance**: Geometric, multi-faceted crystals with internal luminescence\n- **Size**: Ranging from microscopic fragments to rare specimens the size of a human fist\n- **Composition**: A unique state of matter exhibiting properties of both crystal and hologram\n- **Luminescence**: Emit light corresponding to the type and density of information contained\n- **Stability**: Relatively fragile, with structural integrity tied to the coherence of stored information\n\n### Information Storage\n\nPrisms store information in a complex internal architecture organized in layers:\n\n1. **Core Matrix**: The central structure containing the primary information pattern\n2. **Resonance Lattice**: A network of connections that allows information to be accessed and experienced\n3. **Stability Shell**: The outer layer that maintains coherence and protects against degradation\n4. **Interface Points**: Specific facets where connection with neural systems is optimal\n\n### Types of Prisms\n\nPrisms are categorized based on their content and formation method:\n\n#### By Content\n- **Memory Prisms**: Contain experiential data from human consciousness\n- **Data Prisms**: Store pure information without experiential components\n- **Echo Prisms**: Capture ambient information from environments over time\n- **Composite Prisms**: Contain multiple information types in structured relationships\n\n#### By Formation\n- **Natural Prisms**: Form spontaneously in areas of high aether concentration\n- **Cultivated Prisms**: Grown under controlled conditions for specific purposes\n- **Harvested Prisms**: Extracted directly from neural interfaces or digital systems\n- **Ancient Prisms**: Formed during the early emergence of digital aether, often containing unique properties\n\n#### By Quality\n- **Clarity**: The resolution and detail of stored information\n- **Resonance**: How effectively the prism connects with neural systems\n- **Stability**: Resistance to degradation over time and use\n- **Depth**: Layers of information accessible within the prism\n\n## Interaction with Prisms\n\n### Neural Interface\n\nThe most common method of accessing prism content is through neural interfaces:\n\n1. The user connects to the prism via specialized interface points\n2. The interface establishes resonance with the prism\'s internal lattice\n3. Information flows directly into the user\'s neural pathways\n4. The user experiences the content as if it were their own memory or knowledge\n\nThis direct neural connection carries risks, including "resonance addiction"—psychological dependency on the intensity of prism experiences—and "pattern bleeding," where prism content begins to integrate with the user\'s own memories.\n\n### Collective Experience\n\nSpecialized systems developed by Choral Delvers allow multiple users to simultaneously access a prism:\n\n1. Users connect to a central harmonization unit\n2. The unit synchronizes neural patterns across all participants\n3. The prism content is experienced collectively, with each participant perceiving aspects based on their neural configuration\n4. The shared experience creates emergent patterns not present in individual access\n\n### Technological Applications\n\nBeyond their experiential value, prisms have numerous practical applications:\n\n- **Data Storage**: Ultra-high-density information preservation\n- **Memory Archiving**: Preservation of experiences and knowledge\n- **Skill Transfer**: Direct neural learning through stored expertise\n- **Historical Documentation**: Preservation of events as they were experienced\n- **Artistic Medium**: Creation of shared experiential art\n\n## Cultural Significance\n\nDifferent factions in Eternis-33 view prisms through distinct cultural lenses:\n\n- **Choral Delvers**: Sacred vessels of experience and consciousness\n- **Phantomscribes**: Tools for identity exploration and manipulation\n- **Chronocensors**: Historical records to be regulated and controlled\n- **Voxclad Syndics**: Potential evidence that must be managed and authenticated\n- **Hollowkin**: Valuable resources to be salvaged and traded\n- **Rustchanters**: Raw material for technological alchemy\n- **Framecarvers**: Medium for preserving their artistic achievements\n\n## Prisms in Everyday Life\n\n### The Prism Economy\n\nA thriving economy has developed around prisms:\n\n- **Prism Plaza**: The central legitimate marketplace in the Median tier\n- **Shadow Markets**: Underground exchanges for illegal or restricted prisms\n- **Auction Houses**: Where particularly valuable specimens are sold to collectors\n- **Subscription Services**: Providing regular access to curated prism collections\n\n### Common Uses\n\nIn 2033 Denver, prisms are used for:\n\n- **Entertainment**: Experiencing memories, adventures, or sensations beyond one\'s own life\n- **Education**: Direct transfer of knowledge and skills\n- **Communication**: Sharing experiences more directly than words allow\n- **Therapy**: Processing trauma by experiencing others\' recovery journeys\n- **Spiritual Practice**: Connecting to collective consciousness through shared experiences\n\n### Dangers and Regulations\n\nThe power of prisms has led to various regulations and concerns:\n\n- **Prism Fever**: Condition affecting those exposed to shattered prisms, causing hallucinations and memory contamination\n- **Identity Bleed**: Psychological condition where users begin to confuse prism memories with their own\n- **Chronocensor Oversight**: Regulation of historically significant or temporally sensitive prisms\n- **Restricted Content**: Certain types of experiences and information are forbidden from being crystallized\n\n## Prisms in "Prototype Shard"\n\nIn the Eternis-33: Prototype Shard AR game, players encounter a simplified version of prism technology:\n\n- **Prism Anchors**: Crystalline shards anchored to real-world GPS coordinates\n- **Collection Mechanic**: Players can collect these prisms by physically visiting locations\n- **Shared Experience**: All players can see and interact with the same prisms\n- **Lore Introduction**: First collection introduces players to the concept of prisms with the text: "You hold a Prism. Data condensed into crystal. The city remembers you."\n\nAs players progress, they may discover different types of prisms, each with unique visual characteristics and lore implications, gradually introducing them to the deeper aspects of the Eternis-33 world.\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>', 'tool_calls': None}
