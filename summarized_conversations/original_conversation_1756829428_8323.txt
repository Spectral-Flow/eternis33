These geometric, faceted crystals contain captured information, memories, and data patterns that have solidified into physical form.\n\n## Origins\n\n### The Digital Aether\n\nDigital aether emerged as an unexpected consequence of the convergence of several technologies in the early 2020s:\n\n- Quantum network infrastructure created unusual electromagnetic patterns\n- Neural interface proliferation generated persistent brain activity patterns in the environment\n- Atmospheric nanites, originally deployed for climate remediation, began interacting with digital signals\n\nThe catalyst came during the Denver Resonance Event of 2026—a cascading failure in the city\'s power grid created a unique electromagnetic phenomenon that transformed these separate elements into what would become known as digital aether.\n\n### First Crystallization\n\nThe first documented prism formation occurred in 2028, when a concentration of digital aether spontaneously crystallized during an experiment at the University of Colorado Denver. Researchers discovered that the crystal contained perfectly preserved data from the university\'s network—including fragments of student records, research papers, and even personal communications.\n\nThis discovery sparked immediate interest from corporate entities, who quickly developed methods to artificially induce crystallization and control the information captured within.\n\n## Properties of Prisms\n\n### Physical Characteristics\n\n- **Appearance**: Geometric, multi-faceted crystals with internal luminescence\n- **Size**: Ranging from microscopic fragments to rare specimens the size of a human fist\n- **Composition**: A unique state of matter exhibiting properties of both crystal and hologram\n- **Luminescence**: Emit light corresponding to the type and density of information contained\n- **Stability**: Relatively fragile, with structural integrity tied to the coherence of stored information\n\n### Information Storage\n\nPrisms store information in a complex internal architecture organized in layers:\n\n1. **Core Matrix**: The central structure containing the primary information pattern\n2. **Resonance Lattice**: A network of connections that allows information to be accessed and experienced\n3. **Stability Shell**: The outer layer that maintains coherence and protects against degradation\n4. **Interface Points**: Specific facets where connection with neural systems is optimal\n\n### Types of Prisms\n\nPrisms are categorized based on their content and formation method:\n\n#### By Content\n- **Memory Prisms**: Contain experiential data from human consciousness\n- **Data Prisms**: Store pure information without experiential components\n- **Echo Prisms**: Capture ambient information from environments over time\n- **Composite Prisms**: Contain multiple information types in structured relationships\n\n#### By Formation\n- **Natural Prisms**: Form spontaneously in areas of high aether concentration\n- **Cultivated Prisms**: Grown under controlled conditions for specific purposes\n- **Harvested Prisms**: Extracted directly from neural interfaces or digital systems\n- **Ancient Prisms**: Formed during the early emergence of digital aether, often containing unique properties\n\n#### By Quality\n- **Clarity**: The resolution and detail of stored information\n- **Resonance**: How effectively the prism connects with neural systems\n- **Stability**: Resistance to degradation over time and use\n- **Depth**: Layers of information accessible within the prism\n\n## Interaction with Prisms\n\n### Neural Interface\n\nThe most common method of accessing prism content is through neural interfaces:\n\n1. The user connects to the prism via specialized interface points\n2.
