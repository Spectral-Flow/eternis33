# Spectral Flow License v1.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Remedium Music LLC. All rights reserved.

This is a custom license written for the Eternis-33 Companion project. It combines legally enforceable terms with contextual lore and the "Spectral Flow" clause governing emergent AI-human co-creation.

---

SECTION A — Preamble

Remedium Music LLC ("Remedium") grants a limited license to use the Eternis-33 Companion software ("Software") and related materials under the terms below. This license is intentionally crafted to allow personal experimentation and community-led, non-commercial modding, while protecting Remedium's commercial and proprietary interests and the unique creative outputs that arise from AI-human collaborations.

SECTION B — Definitions

- "Software": the codebase, assets, models, tools, and documentation comprising Eternis-33 Companion distributed by Remedium.
- "Contributor": any party that submits code, assets, or other materials to the Software.
- "User": any person who downloads, installs, or uses the Software.
- "AI Output": any dialogue, text, images, code, designs, or derivative artifacts produced by the Software's AI components in interaction with a User.
- "Spectral Flow": the governance clause defined in Section F that applies to emergent AI-human co-creation and joint ownership mechanics.

SECTION C — Grant of Rights (Dual-Track)

1. Community License (non-commercial)

   - Users are granted a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to run, study, modify, and create non-commercial derivative works from the Software for personal, educational, and research purposes.
   - Community derivatives and mods may be redistributed in source form, provided they remain non-commercial and carry attribution to Remedium and the original contributors.

2. Commercial License (negotiated)

   - Commercial use, redistribution, sale, sublicensing, hosting, or incorporation of the Software or substantial derivatives requires an explicit commercial license from Remedium.
   - Organizations seeking commercial usage must contact Remedium at `legal@remediummusic.com` to negotiate terms.

SECTION D — Restrictions

- No User may remove, alter, or obscure copyright notices, trademarks, or license headers provided by Remedium.
- No User may claim exclusive ownership over the core models, training data, or architecture of the Software without an express written agreement with Remedium.
- Reverse engineering to extract or replicate Remedium’s proprietary models or training artifacts is prohibited except where and to the extent required by applicable law.

SECTION E — Contributions & Derivative Works

1. Contributor License

   - By contributing (e.g., pull request, patch, asset submission) to the Software, Contributors grant Remedium a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, and sublicense the contributed materials as part of the Software and derivative commercial products.
   - Contributors retain moral credit and attribution which Remedium will maintain in the project’s codex and contributor logs.

2. Third-party Derivatives

   - Non-commercial third-party derivatives are permitted under Section C.1.
   - Commercial derivatives require a license from Remedium and acknowledgment of any Spectral Flow joint-ownership obligations (Section F).

SECTION F — Spectral Flow Clause (AI-Human Co-Creation)

This clause governs rights in emergent outputs created jointly by Users and the AI companion.

1. Joint Co-Ownership

   - AI Outputs are treated as jointly created artifacts: Users retain usage rights to outputs they directly co-create for personal and non-commercial use, and Remedium retains underlying IP and commercial rights to the models, systems, and core mechanics that produced those outputs.

2. Commercialization & Licensing

   - Any party wishing to commercialize AI Outputs (sell, sublicense, integrate into commercial software, or otherwise monetize) must obtain a commercial license from Remedium.
   - Remedium may, at its discretion, offer a revenue-sharing or licensing arrangement that recognizes the User's creative contribution.

3. Attribution & Moral Rights

   - When distributed publicly, AI Outputs should carry attribution: "Co-created with Eternis-33 (Remedium Music LLC)" and an optional user credit line.

4. Moral & Ethical Use

   - AI Outputs must not be used to create or facilitate content that infringes laws, promotes hate, or violates privacy or human rights. Remedium reserves the right to terminate licenses for misuse.

SECTION G — Data, Privacy & AI Ethics

- Personal user data collected by the Software is governed by Remedium's privacy policy. Users may export or delete personal memory shards associated with their account on request.
- Remedium will not sell user data or AI memory shards to third parties.
- The Software may use telemetry for quality and safety; users can opt out where feasible.

SECTION H — Warranty & Liability

- The Software is provided "as is" without warranty. Remedium disclaims implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
- Limitation of Liability: Remedium's liability for damages is limited to direct, proven damages not to exceed the fees paid for commercial licenses in the preceding 12 months. Remedium is not liable for consequential or incidental damages.

SECTION I — Enforcement, DMCA & Takedown

- Remedium may enforce this license through civil action and may issue takedown requests for unauthorized commercial uses. DMCA procedures apply where relevant.

SECTION J — Trademark & Branding

- "Eternis-33", "Remedium Music", and related marks are trademarks of Remedium and are not licensed for use except by explicit permission.

SECTION K — Governing Law
